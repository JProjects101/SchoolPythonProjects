# SchoolPythonProjects
These are various Python scripts I wrote while in school. *I claim no ownership or copyrights to this material. This is all for educational purposes. 
These projects can be copied and pasted into OS environemnts such as Windows using Notepad.
These projects can then be opened and used in PyCharm 2022.1 to open and edit.
